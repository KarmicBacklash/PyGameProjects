# Flow control in python works very simply.

if x = 1: #This is an if statement, if the condition after "if" is true, it executes the following command
    print("hello world") # This is what it does if the condition is true

elif X = 2: # This command will execute if the variable equals something else specifically.
    print("hello other world")

else: # Finally, this part executes if anything else besides the pre-described
    print("goodbye cruel world")
